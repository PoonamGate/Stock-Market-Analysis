# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using LSTM

This project implements an analysis and prediction model for stock market data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) widely used for time-series forecasting.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Retrieves historical stock market data from sources like Yahoo Finance or other APIs.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis by handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into trends, patterns, and correlations in the stock market data through visualizations.
- **LSTM Model Implementation**: Builds and trains an LSTM model to predict stock prices based on historical data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measures the model's accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualizations of predicted vs. actual prices.
